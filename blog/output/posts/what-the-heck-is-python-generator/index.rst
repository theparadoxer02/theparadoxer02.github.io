While understanding the different python concepts I came across the topic Generator and Iterator, Which of them is faster, what is yield keyword etc. I tried googling and found a bunch of blog posts. Each of them had their own ways of explaining things which ended making me more frustrated. I started from scratch again and it took a concerted effort to understand the underlying concept.
What are Generator functions?
A function containing a yield keyword inside a loop is called a Generator. And if there is no yield keyword it is an Iterator.
How is it different from an iterator?
Basically Iterators contains two main methods:

Each of them had their own ways of explaining things which ended making me more frustrated. I started from scratch again and it took a concerted effort to understand the underlying concept.
What are Generator functions?
A function containing a yield keyword inside a loop is called a Generator. And if there is no yield keyword it is an Iterator.
How is it different from an iterator?
Basically Iterators contains two main methods:&lt;/p&gt;
